# advanced-operating-system-csc716
In this repository, I explore advanced topics in computer operating systems with a special emphasis on distributed computing and the services provided by distributed and real-time operating systems. Topics I cover may include multithreading, real-time scheduling, synchronization, and concurrency; interaction of concurrent processes; network management and computer security; protection, remote procedure calls, transactions, shared memory, message passing, and scalability. Additionally, I dive into other selected topics in state-of-the-art operating systems.
